Let's pretend you have a project folder on your hard drive labeled C:AlsPythonBook. You need to create "snapshots" of the entire folder in case something happens to your computer, so you decide to use ZIP files. In order to distinguish between revisions, you'd like to have each new ZIP file's name begin with a number, such as AlsPythonBook_1.zip, AlsPythonBook_2.zip, Organizing Files 209 and so on. 

You could do this manually, but it's tedious and you might mess up the names of the ZIP files if you do. It would be much easier to just use a piece of software to deal with this mundane duty.
Start a new file editor window and name it backupToZip.py; this will be the working file for the project. That's where this helps.
